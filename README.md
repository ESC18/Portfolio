## Description of Application:
This Website is a new and improved portfolio page that was made to better represent my current and future web development skills. It has the ability to store and display data through DOM manipulation and is easy to update compared to the previous versions of my portfolio page. There are also future updates coming which will introduce various tools that web developers can use.

## Setup and installation requirements/guide:
1. First download the repository _"Portfolio-Landing-Page"_ to your device.
2. Proceed to navigate to the highest level of your directory.
3. Open index.html.

## Known Bugs:
* Site is not engineered for responsive design. For best results use with a 1920x1080p monitor.
* Overflow is present on About page.
* Search bar may struggle with certain words such as "A," where both the "no results found" response and a card may appear.
